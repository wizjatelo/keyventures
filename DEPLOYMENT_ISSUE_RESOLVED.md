# 🚨 DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

## ❌ Root Cause of Deployment Failure

The deployment is failing because **Render is trying to deploy the wrong repository**:

```
==> Cloning from https://github.com/wizjatelo/keyventures
```

**This is NOT your LineMart repository!**

## ✅ Issue Resolution

### 1. **Repository Problem**
- Render is configured to deploy from `wizjatelo/keyventures` 
- This repository doesn't contain your LineMart code
- It likely has a different package.json structure

### 2. **Build Command Issue**
- The wrong repository's package.json is being used
- The build command `yarn start` is trying to run `cd linemart-frontend && npm start`
- But the `linemart-frontend` directory doesn't exist in the wrong repository

### 3. **Missing Dependencies**
- Since it's the wrong repository, `react-scripts` isn't installed
- The dependency installation is happening in the wrong project structure

## 🔧 SOLUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Create Correct Repository
1. **Create a new GitHub repository** for your LineMart project
2. **Initialize git in your local project**:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\my pc\Desktop\linemart"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial LineMart implementation"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/linemart.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Update Render Configuration
1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Update the repository URL** to your new LineMart repository
3. **Use the updated render.yaml** configuration I provided

### Step 3: Redeploy
- Render will now clone the correct repository
- The build commands will work properly
- Dependencies will be installed correctly
